# Instructions for using script "assessment_reclassify10percent.js"

The purpose of this script is to assess the consistency of the identified structures in GROD by reclassifying 10% (N = 3336) structures. The UI of the script will allow you to
quickly look through these structures and while at each structure we would like you to help classify strutures in the satellite image.

## To set up the script
1. copy and paste the entire [script](https://github.com/GlobalHydrologyLab/GROD/blob/master/1_user_interface_script/assessment_reclassify10percent.js) into an empty GEE script and save the file;
2. assign the variable __NAME__ your first name;
3. run the script will generate a control panel at the bottom of the map;
4. input your starting index in the text box and hit enter;
5. the map will move to the structure with that index;

## Start classifying
6. similar to identifying and classifying structures for GROD, identify and classify structures that indicated by a red point at the center of the map;
7. when finished classifying current structure, click next will move the map view to the next structure;
8. when exit, take note of the current index, save the script, click run again, and export the data as csv.
